# Australian Rain Prediction Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression using Scikit-Learn in Python to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia. The notebook covers:

- Downloading and exploring the dataset
- Implementing logistic regression
- Handling categorical features
- Analyzing model coefficients and making predictions
- Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics

The Jupyter Notebook details each step of the process, from data cleaning and preprocessing, through to model training and evaluation. It includes exploratory data analysis with visualizations to understand relationships within the data, feature engineering to improve model input, and using logistic regression to make predictions. The notebook concludes with an evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Files

- `Aus_RainPrediction_LogisticRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.
- `README.md`: This guide explaining the project and its files.
- 'Notebook PDF': PDF of Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Weather Dataset" from the Australian government, available on Kaggle. It contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).

## Note on Interactive Graphs

 Due to GitHub's static rendering of Jupyter Notebooks, interactive Plotly graphs do not display directly. For full visualization, please refer to the included PDF file of the notebook, which contains all plots.
